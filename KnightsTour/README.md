# KnightsTour

My implementation of the Knight's Tour problem using backtracing. Change the values of FIRST_DIM and SECOND_DIM in the source code to adjust the board dimensions. The answer will either be false, or true with the solution of the board beneath it. You can also adjust the starting position for the knight by changing the perimeter in the line 12.
